# Version 1.2 #

  * Last version was missing many of the snippets I thought I had included.  Sorry!
  * Including: if, list, assign, local, compress, compress single\_line, and macro.

# Version 1.1 #

  * Added several more snippets for directives: if, else, list, compress, etc.
  * Organized the bundle menu

# Version 1.0 #

  * Very minimal Language definition that mostly plays well with HTML, but not completely.
  * A few useful snippets for Freemarker tags.
  * One simple HTML template.
